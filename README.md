A free and open source biodiversity data entry software

Ecologists have struggled with environmental data management issues for many years now. It has become urgent to focus on building the technological solutions required for a more efficient process of data collection, exchange, and analysis.

To address this issue, we have starting an ambitious open source effort based on open source components.


We provide Software for Field Worker: that actually run the data collection and data entries

ecoReleve data is design to allow field data entry on any devices (IOS, Android and Window). It stores data local and let you upload it to the Core module when ready.

The data entry forms are fully customizable to allow users to design their own protocols.

## Features


## Instalation


### Requirements

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/))
 - [bower](http://bower.io/) `npm install -g bower` (run it in an console with administrator privileges)
 - [python3.4](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/) (for Windows you can install [miniconda3.4](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html))


*Verify that node is in your PATH*

### Instalation Process

#### Front
- `npm install`
- `bower install`

optional but recommended :

- `grunt build`

#### Back

Install those packages with `pip` or `conda` :

- pyodbc (for SQL Server database) or psycopg2 (for PostrgreSQL database)
- reportlab
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- zope.interface
- pandas=0.18.0
- pywin32
- pycrypto

Run the setup install : 
- `python setup.py install` or `python setup.py develop` (for development version)

Also, you can run the [install.bat](https://github.com/NaturalSolutions/ecoReleve-Data/blob/master/Back/install.bat) file in the [Back folder](https://github.com/NaturalSolutions/ecoReleve-Data/tree/master/Back/)
which will launch all commands in order to install this project (Front setup & Back setup).

An error can occured if an other instance of pyramid WGSI run with the `pserve` command. Don't worry, it does not have any impact. 

## Technolgies && Usage

### Front

> npm
> bower

You have to configure the [config.js](https://github.com/NaturalSolutions/ecoReleve-Data/blob/master/Front/app/config.js.default) file 

* Grunt :
 `grunt build` build the code : 
  1. compile less files to app/styles/main.css (+ map file in dev mode)
  2. build html files with JST (app/build/templates.js)
  3. build js files : requirejs optimisation, minify and uglify (app/buil/prod.js)
  4. run jasmine test (soon replaced for mocha)

- `grunt release` : launch `grunt build` then change entry file in the index for production mode (prod.js)

- `grunt dev` : launch `grunt build` then change entry file in the index for development mode

 RequireJS
 Backbone Underscore
 MarionetteJs
 Leaflet



### Back

 >[Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/)
 >[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)


You have to configure the [development.ini](https://github.com/NaturalSolutions/ecoReleve-Data/tree/master/Back/development.ini.default) which can be found in the [Back folder](https://github.com/NaturalSolutions/ecoReleve-Data/tree/master/Back/)
Run `pserve development.ini` command in order to launch a Pyramid server.
